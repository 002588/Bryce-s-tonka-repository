      <p> Hi! My mane is Bryce and I am thinking that you are wondering what this webpage is about.
       This site was made to tell you a little bit about me. I created this site using <HTML> on GitHub.
       This site has a few pages, Home, About, and the Computer Science Projects page. The About page
       contains stuff about me and what I have been doing in my Computer Science class. The CS Projects
       page has a list of all of the projects I have done related to Computer Science. There will also be
       an images page so you can see what I like to do!</p>
