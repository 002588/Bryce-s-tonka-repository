       <p>I am here to tell you about me as a coder.
       I started coding in third grade using Scratch.
       Scratch is a block based coding website so you can learn the basics of coding.
       My scratch.mit.edu account is smileyman00, feel free to check out the projects that I have made.
       My favorite one is a remix of Super Mario Bros, the difference between mine and the original is in mine, Mario talks!</p>
